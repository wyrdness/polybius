## Overview

Polybius is an **urban legend** about an arcade game allegedly released in Portland, Oregon in 1981, supposedly causing severe psychological effects in players before mysteriously disappearing. The legend claims the game was a government psychology experiment, monitored by men in black, that caused amnesia, night terrors, hallucinations, and even suicides.

**THIS GAME NEVER EXISTED**. No evidence supports any aspect of the Polybius story. The legend emerged on coinop.org around 2000, likely as a hoax or creative fiction. Despite thorough investigation by retro gaming historians, no arcade cabinet, ROM, screenshots, or contemporary documentation has ever been found. No Portland arcade operators, gamers, or media from 1981 remember any such game or incidents.

The legend combines real arcade history (1981 was peak arcade era, government did conduct experiments), Portland-specific details for verisimilitude, and classic conspiracy tropes (MIBs, government mind control, cover-ups). It represents **modern folklore creation** in the internet age.
